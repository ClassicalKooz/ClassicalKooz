# GhostPopulationSimulation
Population Divergence with 3 populations, with 1 population acting as a ghost but still able to engage in gene flow

msprime3pop.py is an msprime tskit simulator that simulates lineages backwards in time. it also contains a tskit to vcf converter that creates vcf files that are able to be analyzed with the PPP.py

Models 1-15 are examples of varying levels of gene flow between populations

Melissa_Simulated_Data is newly created data to help supplement the "Accounting for Gene Flow from Unsampled ‘Ghost’ Populations" paper
